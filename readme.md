# Ono, a DIY Open Source Social Robot
Ono is a huggable, social robot for children.
His face can display a huge range of emotions.
Unlike other social robots, Ono is completely made using DIY techniques, making social robotics accessible to everyone!

Ono is still very much WIP, which means that documentation is still lacking.
However, the files in this repository should make it possible for motivated individuals to assemble a working (skeletal) Ono.

Folders are:
- CAD files
  Siemens NX (Unigraphics) files of the robot.
  There's also a STEP file of the entire robot, which should help if you're using different CAD software.
- Laser cutting files
  Ono is largely built using lasercutting. The vector files for all laser cut parts can be found in this directory.
- Software
  Arduino software to control Ono via an SSC-32 servo controller and a joystick.
